## Framework Info

We have the android client project in the "Client" folder and the ktor server project in the "DataProxy" folder.

If you want to have an easy time you might want to use 

Android studio for the client 

and 

Intellij for the DataProxy.

Also, as we have two seperate Projects, a Github tool like "Github Desktop" for the whole repository might be useful.

Further information can be seen from the README files in each seperate folder.


The whole Setup has only been tested on Ubuntu Version 20.
